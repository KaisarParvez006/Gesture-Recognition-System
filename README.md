# Gesture Recognition System

## Internship Project (CodeClause)
### 🤖 Domain: Artificial Intelligence  
### 🌟 Level: Golden  

---

## 🎯 Aim
To create a system that recognizes hand gestures from a webcam feed using deep learning (CNNs).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

---

## 📷 How It Works
1. Captures real-time video from your webcam.
2. Focuses on a fixed square region (ROI).
3. Preprocesses the image and passes it through a trained CNN model.
4. Displays the predicted gesture on screen in real-time.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Live video processing with OpenCV
- CNN-based image classification
- Real-time interaction and prediction
- Python integration with Keras models
